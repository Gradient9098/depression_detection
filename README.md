# depression_detection

There are two code files in this project, model_training and model_evaluation.

ZT92899 has been the primary person to work on model_training. He developed the dataset class, model class, and wrote the code to train the machine learning model. 
For this notebook, CN66572 assisted with initial data exploration, restructuring/generalizing a lot of the code, and saving the model.

ZT92899 and CN66572 have both been involved with developing model_evaluation. As mentioned before, ZT92899 developed the code for the dataset and 
model class. ZT92899 also developed the initial code for counting the number of parameters in the model and for getting the model's accuracy. 
CN66572 significantly restructured/generalized much of that code alongside developing the part of the notebook related to explaining the results 
using LIME.

PV07456 has intentionally not been involved in the development portion of the project. 
He has contributed to the project through preliminary research and by leading the paper writing/powerpoint parts of the project.
