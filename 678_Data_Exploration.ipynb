            " I’m sad : It’s kinda always been an issue. I wouldn’t say it’s as bad as my peers but it’s definitely bad. There’s a lot that I obviously can’t write cause it would take a while but I’ll just say the grand scheme of things. So basically I’m not really happy. I haven’t been happy. It definitely started to get really bad last year but it was always an issue growing up. I was very emotional growing up and by the time I was in 4th or 5th grade I had self esteem issues. There wasn’t much of a reason why, I just did. I didn’t like myself. Tbh I hated almost everything about myself until like middle of 7th/8th grade. I found a group of friends that I would hang out with everyday and everything felt authentic. Like we always said shit how it was and got along great. We did lie about something or start some shit with each over someone else. Like we just stuck by each other. It’s hard to explain. But they all stopped talking to me. First, one of them ended up stopping talking to me because my friend. Then the other friend just stopped wanting to hang out. It wasn’t that he wasn’t friends with us anymore, he just stayed inside all day. So it was just me and the other friend and he prioritizes school over a lot of things so basically I was alone. Like yeah I could text people but it’s not really enough. It’s not very easy for my to make new friends. I’m an introvert and honestly I’m just awkward if I don’t know you. This all happened in 10th grade. 11th grade was by far my worst year. My grandfather passed away. He was more of a father to me, as my dad wasn’t really in my life for the first 10 years. I found a girlfriend and she cheated on me. My grades were slacking causing more stress. I was alone. I had 1 close friend. There was a lot of times where I honestly wanted to kill myself. I found another girlfriend. Shes been great. We’re very close. But I still feel depressed. I’m in my senior year now. \n",
            "The whole reason why I started feeling this way was after February break. I had a lot of time to myself and I was able to reflect. A lot of the nights I smoked weed just so I didn’t have to think because I knew it wasn’t going to be well. Every vacation, whether summer, Holliday, April, February, whatever, I get really sad. I don’t smoke when I have school or if I have to do something in the morning cause the mornings are hell. So I was thinking. I realized I’m very dependent on people. I need social interaction in real life to stay happy. The issue is I’m not able to get it. Even when I do, I’m sometimes still not happy. I just don’t know what to do. About a month ago, me and my gf broke up. She wasn’t happy. I was obviously sad about it, but I was finally gonna get help for everything because as bad as it sounds, I know I need her. Without her, I genuinely don’t think I can live. She’s pretty much all I have at this point I feel like. I would never tell her this, as I don’t want her to feel trapped. \n",
            "I don’t know what to do. I can’t really bring myself to tell my mom about it. My sister was suicidal and it hurt my whole family. I just don’t want her to feel bad. I don’t want to be put on meds or something either, but I just don’t know what to do. I stayed home from school yesterday and I want to again. I have no motivation. There’s a lot more to it I just kinda wrote this up in a couple minutes. I probably forgot some important stuff but the main issue is really this paragraph. I know I have some issue. I just don’t know how to fix it, well more so I can’t bring myself to tell anyone. | not depression\n",

In my family if you talk about your problems then you’re just attention seeking so I try not to. I guess I’m just tired of keeping it all to myself. This year I left my 4 year long abusive relationship. He raped me, he stalked me after we broke up, and harassed me relentlessly. I was scared to leave my own home. I was scared to even be *in* my own home. I was always worried that he’d show up and I spent most of my time with all of my doors locked and hiding behind the couch. I thought it would get better. Then I developed some major health problems and lost my job because of it. I loved my job. A lot. It was such a huge escape for me and it was always so fun for me to do. I had to have surgery and during that surgery i was awake the entire procedure and ever since then it’s made my mental health so much worse. The house I was trying to buy was sold, and now that I have no job who’s gonna sell me a house anyways? It’s like every time it starts looking up then it gets a million times worse. I don’t even know what to do at this point. Nothing is getting better. Everything is getting worse than I can handle and it just keeps coming. I need a break. I need something. Even if I just got my job back it would help immensely. I just want relief. | not depression\n",
